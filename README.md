# hello-world
Shining justice burns on in me
In this strange town I don't ever wanna leave
Everybody raise your hand
Bring it straight up to the sky
As the will inside us takes us to the top
Let joy bring love and greatness for all
Love is a precious gift
That I'd do anything to share with you

Let the voice of love take you higher
And I'll love you even more
Till the day you find the light
1999 Bizarre Summer
No matter where we roam I won't forget these
Great Days
